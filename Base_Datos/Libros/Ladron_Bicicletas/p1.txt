- I've been coming here
for two weeks now. - Ricci?
Is Ricci here?
- Ricci!
- Ricci!
Ricci?
Are you deaf or what? come on!
I'm a bricklayer.
Do I have to starve to death?
Sorry, there's really
nothing I can do.
Just be patient and we'll
try and get you all sorted out.
Let's see what we can do.
Oi, Ricci, you've got a job.
- A job?
- Bill poster.
You've got to report
to the bill-posting offices.
Give him this
and take your employment card along.
Anything for us?
The hell with it!
And us?
There are two turners' jobs,
but there are no turners here.
And if you're not a turner,
what do you do? Gather dust?
Don't take it out on me!
Hey, Ricci, remember your bike!
You have to have a bike.
A bike? I have and I haven't.
I can't get my hands on it right now.
Perhaps in a few days' time.
You need one straight away
or they won't take you on.
I can do it on foot
for the first few days.
If you haven't got a bike, you'll
have to let someone else take it.
- I've got a bike.
- So have I. -Me too!
But you're a bricklayer!
Change my category!
You can't! Now, have you got
a bike or haven't you?
I've got one, I've got one.
Remember if you haven't got a bike,
there's nothing doing, right?
Think I'm going to wait another two
years? I'll be there with a bike.
- Casati!
- Over here!
Two days' labouring work,
if you want it.
Maria!
What is it?
- Am I unlucky, or what?
- What's up?
There's a job for me,
but I can't take it.
What did you say? I didn't hear.
Wait a minute, Antonio.
What did you say? You've got a job?
A good one, too. With the council!
Well, it's a start, Antonio.
What do you mean, start!
I need a bike, and right away.
If I don't go along straight away,
they'll give it to someone else.
- What shall I do?
- What do you expect?
- Morning, missus.
- Morning.
You shouldn't have pawned
your bike!
- And how were you supposed to eat?
- Shut up!
It's always the same! I might
as well go and jump in the river.
Get up, Antonio!
What are you doing?
You don't have to have
sheets to sleep, do you?
They're just sheets.
They're made of linen and cotton.
Quality stuff. Wedding presents.
They're used.
Four are used. Two are new.
- How many are there?
- Three doubles and three singles.
And three.
- Seven thousand lire.
- Seven thousand?
Can't you give us a bit more?
They're used.
Stick these in, too.
Seven thousand five hundred.
Name?
Ricci Maria. Valmelaina.
Flight H, number 1.
Number 1....
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.
One, two, three, four and five.
- Thanks.
- Bye.
It's a bike.
Six thousand, one hundred.
Why?
Interest. It's the 31st.
Here you are.
It's that Fides.
Near the red one.
I know, I know.
Excuse me,
is the job still free?
Hang on a second!
- Where's the head clerk?
- Over there.
Put it down! What's wrong?
Scared?
- Put your bike down!
- Sorry.
I'm Antonio Ricci.
The Valmelaina unemployment office
sent me.
You can start tomorrow morning.
Go to the stores and get your stuff.
- Thanks! Bye.
- Good bye.
- Bye!
- Bye.
- Tomorrow at a quarter to seven!
- On the dot!
- How'd you get on?
- Fine. It's all arranged.
- What have you got there?
- A bit of work for you, too.
The cap needs taking in.
It's a bit too big.
come over here! Look.
Everyone's got their own locker.
See how big it is?
They used to give us shoes, too.
Not bad... the pay's good, too.
Six thousand a fortnight,
plus family allowance and overtime!
Can I drop by via della
Paglia a second?
- What for?
- To see a woman who works there.
- A woman?
- Yes, a woman.
Stay here.
Who lives here?
I told you, a woman.
I'll only be in a minute.
- But...
- I'll be right back.
Hurry up, then.
- Is that mine?
- No, it's mine.
- Look, it's mine..
- No it isn't, it's mine,..
..that's five/three.
- Porter!
- Porter!
Excuse me. Is this
where the wise woman lives?
- The wise woman?
- Yes, the seer.
I don't know.
Let's try the first floor.
- Is this where the wise woman lives?
- Yes. The door at the end.
- come on. Your turn.
- Don't touch it.
- could you watch it for a second?
- Yes.
- Door at the end.
- When March and April were over....
- How long is it?
- More than a year.
- You could have brought him along.
- How can I lift him?
- What should I do?
- That one, yes, and that one, no.
My Lord, show me the light!
Your son will rise up
from his bed before the leaves fall.
- What's that mean?
- Maria! Let's go!
It means your son
will get better in the autumn.
- Maria! Come on, let's go!
- No.
Maria! Come on, let's go.
- What are you doing here?
- I owe her fifty lire.
Don't be daft!
She said you'd find a job.
Have you got one or not?
I want to due my duty.
- Know what I think if you go in?
- Give over.
How can a woman like you,
with two children,..
..believe in all
this tripe and these tricks?
What are you doing?
As if you had money to burn!
What the hell's got into you?
Can't you find any better way
of spending your money?
I'm grateful to her.
Did she find the job for me?
Come on, move!
Don't be so daft. Let's go home.
come on, Bruno,
it's already half past six.
I can't clean it properly,
there's not enough light.
Did you see what they've done?
They've scratched it.
So what? It was probably like that.
No, it wasn't.
And there's a dent.
God knows how they store them.
I'd have said:
.."You're not the one
who pays for the repairs!"
- Will you shut up?
- That's what I'd have said.
- Is my cap ready, Maria?
- Yes.
- What have you made?
- Omelette.
Let's have a look at you.
Mm, will you look at that!
- Do I look good?
- You look like a cop!
- Hey!
- Lay off! It hurts!
You'll wake the baby!
Here you are, Bruno. Omelette.
Let's go.
- Bye, Mum!
- Bye, Maria!
Bye.
Bye, Bruno. See you at seven
this evening. Wait for me here.
- Bye, Dad!
- Bye.
Morning!
First you spread
the glue like this.
There you go.
Then you stick up the poster.
Then you go over it lightly
with the glue again,..
..so that there are
no wrinkles. Got it?
Hi, kids.
If you leave any wrinkles in....
....the inspector fines you.
Got it?
You have to be intelligent, quick,
and have a good eye for this job.
That's it done. Let's go.
- See you around. Bye.
- Thanks. Bye.
