Stop thief!
What happened?
- Climb up! Climb up!
- Come on, hurry up.
I saw him going
towards the tunnel.
Hurry up.
What's wrong?
- Well?
- I must have been mistaken.
- I was sure he went this way.
- Oh, well!
Yes, there was a crowd. But they
just went about their business....
Mailani!
What is it?
- You're going to the meeting.
- No, Cap's going.
He's changed. You go.
Sign here.
- Cavroni?
- Yes sir.
- It's our turn.
- come on, quick.
- can you do anything?
- You have the time, you look for it.
Have I got to walk round
the whole of Rome?
I don't know what it looks like.
You've got a description
and the registration number.
It'd take the whole flying squad
to look for a bike!
So what's the point
of reporting it?
Tomorrow you might find it
in some bike stall,..
..all you have to do is call
a policeman and everything's official.
- Anything new, Brigadier?
- Just a bike been stolen.
Thanks. Goodbye.
So I have to sort it out myself?
It's fine as it is. You've reported
it. It's fine as it is. Goodnight.
Goodnight.
You'd like to, wouldn't you?
Hello Bruno.
Hey, Dad! It's half past seven!
I came back by bus. come on.
What about the bike?
- Is it broken?
- Yes, it's broken.
Go inside. I'll be in in a minute.
Go on!
It's not a problem
for the Employment Exchange.
If there's no work,
people won't have jobs.
Our cell has already
told the branch that..
..and the Working Men's Association.
Dole money doesn't solve anything,
it humiliates the worker,..
..it's soon gone
and it doesn't solve the problem.
What we need is a big
public works programme,..
..as they said at the meeting : you
can't expect us to work miracles.
- Who's that? - can you keep quiet
back there? - It's him!
As soon as there's a chance
to help you out, we jump at it.
Hi, Ricci. Good job to have, isn't it?
#....really loved me..#
#..you'd make sure I wasn't taken
for a ride by other people....#
- #People.#
- #People.#
Alright.
#If you really,
really loved me..#
#..you'd make sure I wasn't taken
for a ride by other people....#
- #People.#
- #People.#
Be right back.
#People.#
What's up?
I was looking for you.
I want to talk.
- What's up?
- They've nicked my bike.
You're joking... Where?
At the Florida.
While I was sticking up posters.
How did it happen?
Baiocchi, You've got to help me.
I've got to get my bike back.
Easier said than done.
Excuse me a second.
Baiocchi, listen to me
or we'll be here all night!
I'm listening.
#If you really, really loved me....#
Shut up everyone!
You'd make sure I wasn't taken
for a ride. Are you listening?
I'm listening! #Peo-ple.# #Peo-ple.#
Do you think I'm daft?
You carry on.
I'll be there in a tick.
The hell with it!
Piazza Vittorio's
the only place to go.
Go there at night
in order to be among the first!
These thieves try to get rid
of these bikes straight away.
The only thing to do is try there.
Antonio.
Maria.
Is it true?
Don't start. I didn't go home
to avoid listen to your moaning.
Who's moaning? It's not the sort
of thing that happens every day.
Have you done anything?
Have you looked for it?
Don't cry like that,
you look like a little girl.
It wouldn't be the first one
to be found they change the saddle,..
..or the handlebars, but it has
to be at the market tomorrow.
And if it's there,
we'll bring it back home.
You'll lose a bit of sleep tonight,
but don't worry, we'll find it.
Miss,
what would you be doing today?
- I'm walking out with a friend.
- Not with me? - No, mother's here.
This just isn't on!
Either you go or we do.
We rehearse or you chat.
You tell him, Meniconi.
He's right.
You'll never learn anything
from rehearsing!
Trust me,
we'll sort it out somehow.
- See you tomorrow. - Goodnight.
And don't forget what I told you!
Speed things up a bit
or we'll never get out of here.
can you get that cart out of
the way? Have you loaded up there?
- Hey, Baiocchi, I'm here.
- Be right there. Amerigo, over here.
By the way, what was the make?
It was a lightweight Fides,
He knows it better than I do.
So much the better,
at least we can split up.
Bagonghi, we'll go this way.
No, this way's better.
You two look out for the tyres,
you look out for the frame,..
..and the boy can look
at the pumps and bells.
Let's go!
- Fides, it's a Fides frame.
- I heard!
Let's look for it
bit by bit..
..then we'll put it back together.
Keep your eyes open, Bagonghi.
Be on your guard!
He's nothing to do with it.
Let's go this way,..
..don't let them see
we're looking for something special.
Wander about,
as if you're just looking.
There you go,
they're setting up now.
- Damn them all...
- I bet we find it.
I'm really uptight about this!
Oi, Bruno, you look through
the bells and pumps.
If you find anything,
give us a whistle.
You two stay here,
and you come with me.
Remember what I told you.
If we find it, I'll be over the moon.
Hey, move on!
Remember: a Fides.
Want to buy something?
Clear off
and let me get on with my work!
I was here first!
There's no point
in us all being here.
Antonio, take a look at the wheels,
Bagonghi the frames, and the kid..
..the pumps and bells.
I'll go this way.
Come and have a look at this frame.
- What do you think?
- What make is it?
- Why, do you want to buy it?
- No.
Be careful. The paint's fresh.
I want to look
at the number on the frame.
What for?
Are you buying the number?
I want to see the frame number.
And if I won't let you?
I'll go and call a cop.
You can call whoever you want!
Why? Is it stolen?
You have to show the frame number
to anybody who wants to see it.
And what'll you show me in exchange?
Your shoe size?
Why do you want numbers?
Playing a lottery?
No, I don't play the lottery.
Don't you want a bell? You've
been here half an hour already.
Do you want it or not?
How much does the bell cost?
A hundred and fifty lire.
Do you want it?
Makes a really nice sound. Listen!
You've reported the theft,
so there's no need to worry.
Let's have a look at that frame.
Clear off. Can't a body
work in peace any more?
What's wrong? Don't you trust me?
Twelve zero twenty four.
Is that yours?
No.
You're a bit dirty. Here's a rag.
It's not a question
of trust or not.
Some scoundrel stole his bicycle,..
..he has the right to look
if he wants.
Look if you want!
Who's stopping you?
Everyone makes mistakes.
We're all honest here
in Piazza Vittorio!
Yeahhh!
- What d'ya mean, "Yeaah"?
- Nyaaaah!
Forget it. Remember the name Fides.
- Where's my boy?
- He'll be near the carts.
There's nothing doing here.
It's not easy.
Do you want something else?
Bruno, stay by my side.
Let's go!
He'll take you down to Porta
Portese and we'll stay here.
You'll have to go to Porta
Portese this morning.
Go there now.
Go with him. Take it easy.
Go on! Go on!
It's pointless.
There's nothing doing.
It always rains on Sundays.
A day off work and you have
to stay at home all day.
This song and dance
is really getting me down.
These daft kids run out in front
of you, next thing you're in the nick.
It's really coming down now.
It rains every Sunday.
- What happened?
- I fell over!
Here you are.
clean yourself up a bit!
What have you got
to be so scared of?
I don't want to get
my white tie and tails wet.
- You give me only 100 lire?
- That'll do.
- What are we going to do?
- We'll see.
Stop him!
Stop him! Thief!
Let's go and find the old man!
There he is, Dad!
Where has the old sod gone?
Where are you going?
Oi, Bruno!
What are you doing!
Leave off!
Sorry.
I want to talk to that young bloke
you were with.
Where can I find him?
What young bloke?
The one that rode off on a bike.
Why? What's he done to you?
Nothing. I just want to talk
to him about something personal.
How should I know? I don't know him.
He was there with you
under that arch!
There are so many
young blokes around...
- No, over here!
- No!
- Forget it!
- I have to talk to him!
Can you credit it... a poor old bloke
keeping himself to himself....
It's late.
You have to be here before ten.
They told me it was always open!
come on, hurry up, get in.
There are always latecomers.
And the beard is....
Luckily a lot of them
have already had a shave.
I knew it,
We'll end up running late.
I've still got four shaves
and eight haircuts to do.
Just the hair.
No, that's enough for today!
What about the soup?
Later. The mess tins have to be....
If this is anyone's first time,..
..remember that the mess tins
have to be taken into the courtyard.
Come on, don't waste time.
That's the way! Well done.
Line up!
Get in line!
Afterwards everyone has to find
their own mess tin or can.
Might be a nice idea
to have a shave.
- Do you need a shave? - No.
- Well get into church, then.
Sit down.
You get into church.
Will you be long?
No, I've only got this one
and this one.
No, not me.
- So we can begin.
- Yes.
Not here, please.
I'm growing a goatee.
Do the other side.
The priest is waiting.
That'll do, I think, it's late.
- I need more time.
- Let's go. Over here, little boy!
Move up.
I've got to find that young bloke.
I've got to talk business with him.
Where can I find him?
Leave off. I don't know him.
I don't know nothing.
Page six.
I wish to leave
this holy place....
....feeling
pure in spirit....
....and calm....
It's a bit of business
he'd be interested in. Where is he?
It's not my job to know
where people are.
Tell me
or I'll turn you in.
What have I done?
....we must walk along....
Leave it out.
....and walk the streets
of pain and privation.
You just have to tell me where
he is. I've nothing against you.
I can even leave you something.
- What's for lunch?
- Pasta and potatoes.
Going to tell me then?
It'll be worse, if I take you to the
police station. You'll stay there.
Where does he live?
Well, Via della Campanella....
What number?
The hell with it.
Fifteen, I think.
- You're coming with me, then.
- Can't you go on your own?
Either you take me there
or I'll take you there with the cops..
..'cause I've had enough!
Understand?
Keep quiet
or I'll get you thrown out!
- Police.
- Police.
Going to take me there, then?
I ain't going anywhere with you.
- Why? What'll happen to you?
- Clear off!
I'm losing my patience.
You can lose whatever you want!
I could kill you. Want me to get
the cops to take you there?
I don't give a damn!
Can you take me there?
Give it up, alright?
- Come on, move!
- Get your hands off!
- Come on, move!
- That's enough, alright?
- I'll show you.
- Leave it out! - come on!
- Will you get me something to eat?
- Alright, but I'm coming with you.
Just when I was going to get
a decent meal for a change.
- Stop them. - Where are you
going? You can't do that.
- Did a man come by here?
- No. And it isn't time to go yet.
Put a bit more in there.
What the hell do you want?
I want to get out!
The door's shut!
The lawyer's got the key!
Stop that row!
This is a church!
Do you want to get out?
This is no way
to behave in a church.
Stop!
I must find him.
Did you come here just to make
a row? What the blazes do you want?
I'm looking for an old man
who was here!
I must find him.
Where?
Can you see him?
- Christ knows where he is!
- Give it a rest!
He can't have flown away.
I'd have stayed
for the soup.
You can shut up, too!
- Sometimes you... hell! - What're
you doing? Come on, move! - No!
- Are you coming or not? - No!
- Bruno! Come on, move!
- What a kid! Let's go!
- No!
What did you hit me for?
Because you deserved it!
Let's go.
I don't want to come.
Go away!
Come on, move yourself!
Nosy parker!
- Alright, then.
- Think I'm going too far, do you?
I'm going to tell Mum
when we get home!
Alright, we'll sort it out
when we get home.
You wait for me at the bridge.
I'm going to look
for that old man.
