Bruno! Bruno!
Bruno!
- How is he?
- He's alright.
Bruno!
Put your jacket on.
You've been sweating.
Put it on!
Come on!
Up!
Are you tired?
Sit down. There's nothing doing
in any case. We'll go home now.
Is Modena a good team?
Are you hungry?
Do you fancy a pizza?
Come on, then!
Come on, let's go!
What the hell... We might as well
go out in style... what's the point..
..in worrying about it all?
Come over here. Sit down.
Forget everything:
we'll get drunk!
Waiter!
Rigo, serve this gentleman.
- Half a litre?
- No, a litre and a pizza.
We don't make pizzas here.
- Why not?
- This is a trattoria.
- Well, I want something to eat.
- Something to eat? - Of course.
What would you like?
- Fancy some fried bread
and mozzarella? - Yes.
Two fried bread
and mozzarella and wine.
Then I'll order some sweet, too.
Happy?
Don't you want anything to drink?
If your mother were to see you!
But we're going to do
what we want!
#You can turn him round
or upside down....#
#You can call him Cicc'Antuono,
you can call him Pepp' o Gi'..#
#..he'll still be black as black
can be, as black, as black as you.#
Let's eat!
Any problem can be resolved..
..except death.
You'd need a million a month
to be able to eat like them.
Don't worry, eat up!
To think everything was just
right. I worked it out..
..with overtime it came to...
hang on a bit...
Twelve thousand flat rate....
There you are...
you write it down.
Twelve thousand flat,..
..plus two thousand overtime,..
..plus family allowance,..
..eight hundred lire a day.
Eight hundred times thirty... you
work it out. What more do you want?
I don't want to give up. We've got
to find it. You know that, don't you?
Because if we don't, we won't
be able to eat. What can we do?
We'll have to go
to Porta Portese every day.
We'll have to find those men again.
Them! They won't show
their faces again!
We won't find them
with your Mum's candles, either!
Or with the help of the saints!
Sports News.
Today, Sunday,,..
..on football fields
throughout Italy..
..teams will be playing
their scheduled matches.
The fans' attention is fixed on
the Premier League championship.
Here are the fixtures for today:
in Rome,..
Rome at the National Stadium.
Door at the end.
I'm scared. I don't like the idea
of this kid hearing.
Maria, have no fear, just tell all,
like the confessional, you'll see.
If only it were true,
Mary Mother of God!
That one yes and that one no.
Sow in a different field.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
No, I don't understand.
What do you mean? It's obvious!
What's the use of ploughing the
field, if the ground is infertile?
You plough but you don't harvest.
Get it?
No, I'm afraid
I really don't understand.
She is not for you.
Forget her!
You're ugly, my boy.
You're ugly.
There are lots more women around.
Plough and sow a different field!
Do you like it?
Mum, it's getting cold.
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon. - Afternoon.
- Afternoon. - Afternoon.
Come on, Dad, there's room!
- No, that woman over there first!
- Wait your turn.
Excuse me, but why....
Some people
have been waiting two hours.
- Why don't you wait your turn?
- I'm in a bit of a hurry.
So are we, if you don't mind!
Do this favour for me.
Everybody'd be asking favours then!
Calm down! Keep calm!
This lady's first, then there's
this lady, and then there's me.
Keep calm!
I'll deal with you all.
That one yes and that one no.
My Lord, show me the light!
Give me the light!
What do you want?
- They've stolen my bike.
- What?
- What have they stolen?
- My bike.
What can I say?
I can only tell you what I see.
Listen: you'll find it straight
away, or not at all. Understand?
You'll find it straight away
or not at all. Keep your eyes open.
Where, straight away?
How should I know? Go,
and try to understand what I said.
You'll find it straight away
or not at all.
- Thanks. Good Afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
- Adele, what's wrong today?
- My husband is getting drunk.
He's a real burden,
don't give him any money.
What can I do?
He takes it....
We're shut!
The girls have gone to lunch!
It's shut for everybody!
What the...! O my God! A kid!
Where do you think you're going?
Get out! You can't go in there!
Where's he going now?
Get out of here!
The law's the same for everyone.
Understand?
- Who was it?
- A man!
- A man? And where is he?
- There he is! On the stairs.
You can't go into the rooms!
Get out! Scoundrel!
Leave me alone.
In the dining room?
Get out! Isn't anyone going to
help me? come on, get out of here!
I want to talk to him.
Who the hell are you?
I'll show you who.
Just step outside.
Get out! Call the police!
- Cat got your tongue?
- What are you shouting for?
- I want to have something out
with you. - With me?
- Alfredo, leave over.
- Stop that!
- You want me? - Yes, you.
- Here I am!
No! First give me my bike back!
Clear off! Get your hands off me!
- Give over!
- Get out of here!
This bloke has ruined me!
Let's go outside,
I ain't scared of you.
Get back inside, girls.
Who's he think he is,
disturbing people....
....in the best brothel in Rome!
- I'll teach you to steal.
- clear off!
What'd the superintendent say,
if he knew!
Get out!
Clear off, you layabouts!
Calm down! What's wrong?
- Give back what you took off me!
- What did I take off you?
What do you want?
What did I take from you?
You nicked my bike!
What bike?
I'm no thief!
- You're not going anywhere.
- I'll paste you!
I'll kill you,
if you don't give it back.
I'm not moving from this spot.
Bring it out here now!
Just my luck!
I've got a nutter! Let go!
No!
I've never seen you before,
Let me go!
Do not involve me!
I'm not moving
until you give it back.
I'm not moving
until you give me back the bike..
..you nicked off me
at the Florida yesterday.
Who was at the Florida yesterday?
You were there with this hat!
- But we were just.... - You can't
go around accusing people like that!
- Let me go!
- No, I won't let you go!
Alfredo! Get up here!
He won't let me go!
Take your hands off me. Yesterday
we were at the General Market.
He stole your bike?
Yes.
Before making all this fuss,
are you sure?
- What do you mean am I sure?
- Where did he steal it?
Near the Florida.
If you're so sure, why don't you
go to the police station?
What are you waiting for?
It's near here! Move!
clear off!
What are you waiting for?
Go to the police station.
I'll wait here. I've nothing to hide.
You're not going anywhere.
I'm not daft.
Give it a rest. I've never
seen you before!
Get him out of my sight.
Alfredo!
- You'd better go.
- Right row you've made!
When you accuse someone
you must be certain.
Can't go just accuse
people like that.
Make sure he doesn't hit his head!
You'd better clear off. You have
to be sure before making accusations.
You could end up
getting cited for defamation.
Get rid of him before I kill him!
My beloved boy, apple
of your mummy's eye!
- When are you going to clear off?
- Get your hands off!
Make sure
of what you're saying first.
Go and get
your wallet nicked, too,..
..then come round here
kicking up a row!
Cowards!
You're all thieves!
I just wanted
to cool him down a bit!
Where's this bloke who is supposed
to have stolen the bike?
There he is.
He's pretending to throw a fit.
What do you mean pretending?
He's more dead than alive.
Where do you live?
I live here.
I told him to go to the station.
What have you got
against my son?
He's innocent.
Everyone knows him round here.
That's right.
He says that
he's got a German hat.
This isn't German.
- come on, get up.
- He can't even move!
Brigadier, he should be in hospital
rather than out in the open.
Will you take us upstairs, then?
For God's sake....
We're good people in our house.
Come on.
I'd sue him for defamation!
He's never hurt a fly!
It won't take long to look round.
This is all there is.
There are four of us
live here. He..
..sleeps here. Look and see
if there are any bikes under the bed.
My daughter, another child
and me sleep here.. Ooh!
Instead of coming here to offend us,
why not give the boy a job..
..he's been looking for ages.
Good Grief!
They're my brother-in-law's
tyres: he had an 1100,..
..which he rented.
Look and see if there are
any bikes under the bed.
Look,..
..isn't there anyone
who can act as witness for you?
- I can act as a witness!
- But you....
Would you like to leave
us for a second, ma'am?
Talk as much as you want:
I don't mind!
You might have made a mistake
on your own. Are you sure it was him?
Yes, I'm sure it was him!
Come here.
Look out there. What do you see?
They're all witnesses for him.
You're wasting time.
I see this kind of thing
happening every day.
- Did you really see his face?
- Yes, while he was running away.
You saw him from behind, then.
No, I saw him, because....
- Was there anyone else there?
- Yes, there was.
Can't you give me the name
of a witness?
I had other things to do
then take people's names.
What do you want to do, then?
You didn't see his face,
you've got no witnesses,...
What are you going to do?
You haven't got any evidence.
If he were innocent,
you'd be in a right mess.
You've got to catch these people
red-handed or find the goods.
- I'll smash his face.
- That way you'll end up inside too.
If you only knew
how important this is for me....
Come here.
I'm fine.
Take me along to the station.
What did you find? Nothing!
I'm innocent, I am!
- What's your name?
- Alfredo Catelli.
Do you want to report him?
My boy's innocent!
You'd better clear off!
Are you nuts or what? Go careful!
Come on, Bruno. Let's go..
Don't come back here ever again!
There you are. Take the tram,
go to Montesacro, and wait for me.
Don't just stand there! Move!
Thief! Stop him!
Dad! Dad!
Dad!
Where shall we take him,
the Flaminio station or Parioli?
Flaminio.
Pasquale and I'll go.
Forget it. Don't worry.
You're going
to leave me here... with him?
I don't want any trouble.
'Bye all and thanks very much.
Nice example
you're setting for your kid.
You're lucky. If it were up to me,
I'd take you in.
This is your lucky day.
Get off home! You'd best clear off!
Thank your lucky stars! Clear off!
