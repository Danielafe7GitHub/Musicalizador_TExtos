I knew God was, was with me
I always use to pray, ah
My prayer was I asked God to not to let the devil kill me out here
While I was in the streets before I could get back
But I said if you give me one more chance at life and music
I promise you I'm gon' shout you out
And I'm gon' testify
And we gon' have a little church up in there
Oh, oh, oh, I'm blessed

Wakin' up, thankin' God
Every day is feelin' just like Sunday
Wifey fly, by my side
Green light, everything is going my way
Ridin' clean, livin' dreams
Just left the barber and I'm feelin' like Midas
Heard him say, give Him praise
What's in the water gotcha actin' like this

Ain't a day go by, that I don't try
To thank the Lord up above
And if you wonder why I'm lovin' life
Come close and I'll tell you what's up (Listen)

Ask me how I'm doing, I'm blessed, yes
Living every moment, no regrets
Smile up on my face, I'm like oh
Yes, I'm blessed yes, I'm blessed, yes
Ask me how I'm doing, I'm blessed yes
Living every moment no regrets
Smile up on my face, I'm like oh
Yes, I'm blessed yes, I'm blessed, yes

Playin' cards, laughin' hard
Barbecuin' waking up the whole block
Music loud, turnin' out
Little kids are breakin' out the bus stop
Life is good, really good
And every moment, no I can't forget
I gotta say, I won't change
You're the reason that I am like this

Ain't a day go by, that I don't try
To thank the Lord up above
And if you wonder why I'm lovin' life
Come close and I'll tell you what's up (Listen)

Ask me how I'm doing, I'm blessed, yes
Living every moment, no regrets
Smile up on my face, I'm like oh
Yes, I'm blessed, yes, I'm blessed, yes
Ask me how I'm doing, I'm blessed yes
Living every moment no regrets
Smile up on my face, I'm like oh
Yes, I'm blessed, yes, I'm blessed, yes I'm blessed

I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed
I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed
I'm blessed, I'm blessed, I'm blessed
Oh, oh, oh, I'm blessed
